AlterTrack is a swap AU in a demon mafia hunters theme. What kind of mafia is this? Well, demons and every onther creature live practically good, humans, robots, living flora... ghosts? The point is demons are frequently a menace by their power, or at least is what "The Carriers" think, the demon hunt organization that traffics demons and sends them to laboratories for experimenting and gaining some kind of powers, and countering demon magic. And you can imagine how scary a magia can be, trucks, weapons, drugs, hired armed people, etc...
