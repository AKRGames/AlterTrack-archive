# Disclaimer
- **This is the current version of the AlterTrack lore**, and I don't think it's going to change.
- Since you can't copy text and paste it directly from Wattpad, I wil be typing the story manually.
    - This notice doesn't apply for the synopsis or the chapter titles.
- Since English isn't Dan's first language, there may be broken English, typos, grammatical errors, and/or words in Spanish, just like all the other archives in here.
