# What exactly is AlterTrack? <sub>(Published on January 27th, 2022)</sub>
Friday Night Funkin' AlterTrack is an AU that happens in a world ruled by 3 modern kingdoms, and has some problems between them...<br>The Heaven, The Surface, and The Inferno.<br>Aslo, the small "war" between the music genres for being the best and most popular (indirectly doing it)<br><br>All vs all? Not really, but there exists the rivalry and the alliance between some of them (even family member)<br><br>Also, not all like the music massively, reaching the point of hating it...<br>and they could do anything for stopping them...
