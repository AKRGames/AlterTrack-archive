# Disclaimer
- All of the tweets have been copy-pasted exactly as it was originally posted, with some exceptions, like threads, which have their thread numerotation (i.e. (1/?)) removed. 
- Since English isn't Dan's first language, there may be broken English, typos, grammatical errors, and/or words in Spanish. 
- The time of the tweets posted will be in Colombian time, since Dan lives in Colombia.
- Every segment about a tweet with an **approximate** time cited at the beginning and a *link to the **archived** tweet* at the end is considered non-canon to the current AlterTrack lore. <sub>I really think that some (if not all of them) should remain canon.</sub>
- Think of these tweets as a devlog or something, i dunno.
