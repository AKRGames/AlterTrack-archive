# Disclaimer
- Even though Twitter changed their branding to 𝕏, I will still be using the old terms (e.g. "Tweets" instead of "Posts").
- Although Dan is [a zionist and a LGBTphone](https://twitter.com/acreGemz/status/1731410040320377157), I will still be archiving these tweets.
- Since **both Dan's old account and the AlterTrack account is now *private***, please put any non-archived *-> link to a tweet <-* into the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) in order to visit them.
- All of the tweets have been copy-pasted exactly as it was originally posted, with some exceptions, like threads, which have their thread numerotation (i.e. (1/?)) removed.
- Since English isn't Dan's first language, there may be broken English, typos, grammatical errors, and/or words in Spanish, just like all the other archives in here.
- The time of the tweets posted will be in Colombian time, since Dan lives in Colombia.
- Every entry with an **approximate** time cited at the beginning and/or a *-> link to the **archived** tweet <-* at the end is considered non-canon to the current AlterTrack lore. <sub>I really think that some (if not all of them) should remain canon.</sub>
- Think of these tweets as a devlog or something, i dunno.
