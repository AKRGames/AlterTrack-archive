## Pre-account Era
### On October 18th, 2021, at 7:15 PM COT (UTC-5), DanDream235 (@DanDevDream) tweeted a sort of disclaimer about when AlterTrack started concepting and it's inspirations.
> The concept of this project and the AU itself started en May of this year, so it's not an attempt of copy Saturday Night Swappin. This all came from me and some inspirations from a skin mod made by Sonknux

### On November 29th, 2021, Dan tweeted out a thread about how he joined the Friday Night Funkin' community, how the idea of AlterTrack was concepted, while also  further explaining his inpirations for AlterTrack.
> Someday (maybe in many weeks, months or years) I will be with the biggest in FNF modding with my team (Actually I don't have one, but I will get it. When?, I don't know)
This project will be a gratefulness to the entire FNF community (incluiding FNF developers)

> For being clearer.
When I first met something relationated with FNF (that was between February and March of 2021) I didn't pay too much attention to that game, I never was a fan of rythm games, until my friend Sanfry2111 showed me Funky Friday (roblox game)

> Even with that I wasn't so interested in FNF, and planned only play it for my friend
Many days later one of my favorite YouTubers (STIVENELVRO) uploaded a video about FNF, and that was one of the many crucial moents that made me enter in FNF community

> Then I started to look some memes about FNF (unfortunately from ZEC) I was understanding more about the "charm" of FNF, it was so easy to mod.
First I only played Funky Friday with my Friend
The strong moments are still incoming

> Some days later I finally decided to download the game, try it and... HELL I WAS SO BAD (doing misses in the freaking tutorial ._. ), with the coming days I was upgrading my skills, loking for tips to be better and watching some mods of the moment (Whitty, Carol, MFM, etc)
ㅤ
> All was going normal, watching mods for a game that wasn't in it's first version (0.4.1) and I founded a mod that caught my attention and feelings very hard. Vs Hex mod, I first though that It will be another rival, but then he presented as a very nice robot 

> - without intentions of "don't letting BF date GF and stuff", only for fun. The first 3 songs were normal, were Glitcher appeared I was like "...WHY?!?!" , and strangely during the song, when Hex was singing I heard sreams of help and pain (._. yes, very strange) -

> And that somehow, remebered me when I was in fourth grade "I was hurt and tortured by absolutely nothing, when I only wanted to be nice to the others and show what I like..."
(But I will not be telling about my life right now because it will take SO MANY tweets) 

> That made me more integrated in the community, and the final moment that made me completly into the FNF community (at least in what I remember) was the Everywhere at the end of funk mod...
>
> Somehow it made in me a similar effect like Glitcher but in a sentimental way, -

> - but this being more sad and almost breaking me internally, (it affected me more because before I readed a theory about why BF ended like that) then I tried to imaginate a way to save BF from that demency and going back to normal -

> - (cringe alert and spoiler: I used GachaLife .-. , but I didn't finish it, fortunately of me)
>
> With that, I feelend something that in the past I considered and though stupid, having strong feelings by a game character (specifically, emotional identification)

> (And somehow feeling very sad about that character suffering or having problems...)
>
> With the passing of the weeks I was making more and more histories in my mind about FNF (very personal fan fics when all ends good), mayority with BF family and the EATEOF history -

> - , the rest of the time was playing mods almost 24/7 (yes, I was so hooked to mods and FNF vanilla... MILF was so hard, reason: the drop), until May when I watched a simply skin mod, "Rapper GF", somehow I felt something strange (and it isn't what are you thinking SIMPS)-

> - It was very strange, it was like a "connection?..." or something. I though "hey, seems that she doesn't have an argument of her existence, I can do that", the I was writing like a freak for almost 2 weeks, but when I investigated more about the skin mod, I founded -

> that made me stop completly my intentions of making an history, "Saturday Night Pumpin" (aprox it was in development at the same time I was writing and thinking Rapper GF's history), a sad fact about SNP actually is that  the team suspended the development 8 months ago -

> -..., yes, 8 months ago. I hope that nothing tragic happened (apart from the fact of the main dev's laptop died)
>
> With that known, I started to first do an original design for GF (at that point I wrote so much, so I didn't want to waste that), then the argument and stuff-

> -, for so long I was writing new dialogues, history and decided to do it a mod. At the beggining it wasn't so ambicious and long, but with the pass of the days (with the help of my friend) I decided to make an history very different from the normal FNF mods and mod AU's -

> - Starting with the Tutorial, I made it into a complete week, then with the other weeks and decided that the weeks will have at least 5 songs, and there are 9 weeks so... yes, I'm crazy but.... yes.
>
> I don't know how long it will take to finish -

> - and If the people will be interested in this, but I'm sure of one thing:
This is being made with love and, is a return of the favor that FNF community made me, improving myself and discovering feelings
I hope that I will not be talking alone forever, It's wird sometimes
