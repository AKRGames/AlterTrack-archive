## Pre-account Era
On October 18th, 2021, at 7:15 PM COT (UTC-5), DanDream235 (@DanDevDream) tweeted about AlterTrack's inspirations.
> The concept of this project and the AU itself started en May of this year, so it's not an attempt of copy Saturday Night Swappin. This all came from me and some inspirations from a skin mod made by Sonknux

On November 29th, 2021, Dan tweeted out a thread about how PEAK AlterTrack would be and how he joined the Friday Night Funkin' community.
> Someday (maybe in many weeks, months or years) I will be with the biggest in FNF modding with my team (Actually I don't have one, but I will get it. When?, I don't know)
This project will be a gratefulness to the entire FNF community (incluiding FNF developers)

> For being clearer.
When I first met something relationated with FNF (that was between February and March of 2021) I didn't pay too much attention to that game, I never was a fan of rythm games, until my friend Sanfry2111 showed me Funky Friday (roblox game)

> Even with that I wasn't so interested in FNF, and planned only play it for my friend
Many days later one of my favorite YouTubers (STIVENELVRO) uploaded a video about FNF, and that was one of the many crucial moents that made me enter in FNF community

> Then I started to look some memes about FNF (unfortunately from ZEC) I was understanding more about the "charm" of FNF, it was so easy to mod.
First I only played Funky Friday with my Friend
The strong moments are still incoming

> Some days later I finally decided to download the game, try it and... HELL I WAS SO BAD (doing misses in the freaking tutorial ._. ), with the coming days I was upgrading my skills, loking for tips to be better and watching some mods of the moment (Whitty, Carol, MFM, etc)

> All was going normal, watching mods for a game that wasn't in it's first version (0.4.1) and I founded a mod that caught my attention and feelings very hard. Vs Hex mod, I first though that It will be another rival, but then he presented as a very nice robot 

> - without intentions of "don't letting BF date GF and stuff", only for fun. The first 3 songs were normal, were Glitcher appeared I was like "...WHY?!?!" , and strangely during the song, when Hex was singing I heard sreams of help and pain (._. yes, very strange) -

> And that somehow, remebered me when I was in fourth grade "I was hurt and tortured by absolutely nothing, when I only wanted to be nice to the others and show what I like..."
(But I will not be telling about my life right now because it will take SO MANY tweets) 

> That made me more integrated in the community, and the final moment that made me completly into the FNF community (at least in what I remember) was the Everywhere at the end of funk mod...
>
> Somehow it made in me a similar effect like Glitcher but in a sentimental way, -

> - but this being more sad and almost breaking me internally, (it affected me more because before I readed a theory about why BF ended like that) then I tried to imaginate a way to save BF from that demency and going back to normal -
