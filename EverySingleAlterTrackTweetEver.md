At 6:59 PM COT (UTC-5), he tweeted about mod characters that may appear on the AlterTrack AU.
> Almost every character in this universe is going to have a new and maybe original story. Between the important characters are GF, BF, GF's family, BF's family, Sky, Sarvente and Ruv (maybe...), a very popular god and a crazy clown.

The "very popular god" may refer to [Shaggy](https://fridaynightfunking.fandom.com/wiki/VS_Shaggy#Classic_Shaggy) from the [vs Shaggy](https://gamebanana.com/mods/284121) mod by SrPerez and the "crazy clown" refers to [Tricky the Clown](https://fridaynightfunking.fandom.com/wiki/Tricky_the_Clown) from the [Tricky mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/44334).

At 7:15 PM COT (UTC-5), he tweeted a sort of disclaimer on when AlterTrack started concepting and it's inspirations.
> The concept of this project and the AU itself started en May of this year, so it's not an attempt of copy Saturday Night Swappin. This all came from me and some inspirations from a skin mod made by Sonknux

The "skin mod made by Sonknux" in question is the *Rapper GF* mod and can be found [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/186939).

### On November 4th, Dan tweeted out a 14-tweet thread about problems (that don't exist anymore) on implementing and adapting already existing mod characters into this AU.
> Thinking about the characters (specifically BF's brothers), I'm having some creative problems, because the BF's family is composed of
> -His Dad
> -His Mom
> -Older/Elder brother (A problem between brothers mod character)
> -Big Brother (VS Big Brother mod character
> ...

> -Big Sister (VS Big Sister mod character)
> -Miku (From the Hatsune Miku character and FNF mod character)
> -Kaity (a genderswap BF version)
>
> The problem begins with the first 3 brothers, because all of them have their own lore (specially BB) and I want to respect that lore
> ...

> The BB lore is (in my opinion and perspective) a little delicate and complicated, I respect the work behind His lore and I dont want to simply take the character ignoring his lore.
> Maybe I can talk with them and see if they don't have problem in taking BB and incluiding...

> Him in the universe. 
> Talking about Older Brother, he has lore too but almost the same case with BB, I respect that and I fear that, if I include him in the history, I can have issues with the team behind "A problem between brother" mod.
> And the same for Big sister...

> Maybe problems with the team.
> But 1 thing to be clear, OBVIOUSLY I will give the credit to the creators of characters that I will take for the history of FNF AlterTrack (I'm not that stupid).
> Other characters with similar problems are Beach Brother, Sky, Whitty and Carol...

> Sky and Carol are from BBPanzu (and bfswifeforever too talking about Sky)
> Whitty is from sock.clip (and all know the general problem with using him in mods...)
> Beach Brother is from Squizzle Dizzle (and I know the polemic about the tr@n$ph0b1c jokes from the creator...)

> Why I do this?
> I do this because I'm focused in the characters, but maybe some creators can be incluided in some ways in the history (...BBPanzu...), both for good and bad.
> Sky is actually the most conflictive character to be incluided (almost all know why...)

> But like I said before, I'm focused on the character itself, and I look Sky with good potential in this history and maybe doing this will give her a 2nd chance in the FNF community.
> Other problematic character is Sarvente (the reason, Too much rule 34...)

> And like Sky, I want to give her and Ruv a 2nd chance in the community.
> And finally we have Whitty... (not gonna say too much about him, the creator left FNF and prohibited us to use Whitty in mods...)
> With that in mind I can only include him in the narrative form...

> Because (with the information that I have about the creator), if I add him as a character with participation and a design, maybe I can get problems with sock.clip , I have heard that they prohibited the use of Whitty in mods in general (except for the Date week mod)

> And I'm talking about adding some scenes with Whitty (not taking too much relevancy but also, being nice to see).
> I saw that the team of FNF Neo removed Whitty from the AU, and that puts me to think that, I can have problems if I add Whitty, resulting in a reestructuration

> Of the history and narration, and I want to avoid that.
>
> For being more clear with Sky, bfswifeforever was lying about Sky's age, spamming (or inciting to make and show) rule 34 of her and then becoming the victim of that spam... And all of the rest of the history...

> BBPanzu feeling guilty, then deleting the mod, leaving the sentence "I ruined her life :(".
> I believe in giving Sky a 2nd chance...
> 
> Being more clear with Sarvente and Ruv (created by dokki.doodles), I know and lament what happened with her...
> I will try my best for giving

> To them a good place in the history (and possibly a tribute to the creator).
>
> Now talking about Miku, simply copyright, maybe a change of name or/and design.
> 
> About Carol, only soliciting permission for using her and include her in the history.
> 
> Well, I think that was all...

 This thread was made before the SquizzleDizzle controversy was resolved, before [vs Whitty - Definitive Edition](https://gamebanana.com/mods/354884) was released, and before [the ban on Sky mods was lifted](https://fridaynightfunking.fandom.com/wiki/Sky?so=search#cite_ref-8), so he had some big goals for AlterTrack frfr.

### On November 29th, Dan tweeted out a 19-tweet thread, this time about how he joined the Friday Night Funkin' community and how the idea of AlterTrack was concepted.
> Someday (maybe in many weeks, months or years) I will be with the biggest in FNF modding with my team (Actually I don't have one, but I will get it. When?, I don't know)
> This project will be a gratefulness to the entire FNF community (incluiding FNF developers)

> For being clearer.
> When I first met something relationated with FNF (that was between February and March of 2021) I didn't pay too much attention to that game, I never was a fan of rythm games, until my friend Sanfry2111 showed me Funky Friday (roblox game)

> Even with that I wasn't so interested in FNF, and planned only play it for my friend
> Many days later one of my favorite YouTubers (STIVENELVRO) uploaded a video about FNF, and that was one of the many crucial moents that made me enter in FNF community

> Then I started to look some memes about FNF (unfortunately from ZEC) I was understanding more about the "charm" of FNF, it was so easy to mod.
> First I only played Funky Friday with my Friend
> The strong moments are still incoming

> Some days later I finally decided to download the game, try it and... HELL I WAS SO BAD (doing misses in the freaking tutorial ._. ), with the coming days I was upgrading my skills, loking for tips to be better and watching some mods of the moment (Whitty, Carol, MFM, etc)
ㅤ
> All was going normal, watching mods for a game that wasn't in it's first version (0.4.1) and I founded a mod that caught my attention and feelings very hard. Vs Hex mod, I first though that It will be another rival, but then he presented as a very nice robot 

> - without intentions of "don't letting BF date GF and stuff", only for fun. The first 3 songs were normal, were Glitcher appeared I was like "...WHY?!?!" , and strangely during the song, when Hex was singing I heard sreams of help and pain (._. yes, very strange) -

> And that somehow, remebered me when I was in fourth grade "I was hurt and tortured by absolutely nothing, when I only wanted to be nice to the others and show what I like..."
> (But I will not be telling about my life right now because it will take SO MANY tweets) 

> That made me more integrated in the community, and the final moment that made me completly into the FNF community (at least in what I remember) was the Everywhere at the end of funk mod...
>
> Somehow it made in me a similar effect like Glitcher but in a sentimental way, -

> - but this being more sad and almost breaking me internally, (it affected me more because before I readed a theory about why BF ended like that) then I tried to imaginate a way to save BF from that demency and going back to normal -

> - (cringe alert and spoiler: I used GachaLife .-. , but I didn't finish it, fortunately of me)
>
> With that, I feelend something that in the past I considered and though stupid, having strong feelings by a game character (specifically, emotional identification)

> (And somehow feeling very sad about that character suffering or having problems...)
>
> With the passing of the weeks I was making more and more histories in my mind about FNF (very personal fan fics when all ends good), mayority with BF family and the EATEOF history -

> - , the rest of the time was playing mods almost 24/7 (yes, I was so hooked to mods and FNF vanilla... MILF was so hard, reason: the drop), until May when I watched a simply skin mod, "Rapper GF", somehow I felt something strange (and it isn't what are you thinking SIMPS)-

> - It was very strange, it was like a "connection?..." or something. I though "hey, seems that she doesn't have an argument of her existence, I can do that", the I was writing like a freak for almost 2 weeks, but when I investigated more about the skin mod, I founded -

> that made me stop completly my intentions of making an history, "Saturday Night Pumpin" (aprox it was in development at the same time I was writing and thinking Rapper GF's history), a sad fact about SNP actually is that  the team suspended the development 8 months ago -

> -..., yes, 8 months ago. I hope that nothing tragic happened (apart from the fact of the main dev's laptop died)
>
> With that known, I started to first do an original design for GF (at that point I wrote so much, so I didn't want to waste that), then the argument and stuff-

> -, for so long I was writing new dialogues, history and decided to do it a mod. At the beggining it wasn't so ambicious and long, but with the pass of the days (with the help of my friend) I decided to make an history very different from the normal FNF mods and mod AU's -

> - Starting with the Tutorial, I made it into a complete week, then with the other weeks and decided that the weeks will have at least 5 songs, and there are 9 weeks so... yes, I'm crazy but.... yes.
>
> I don't know how long it will take to finish -

> - and If the people will be interested in this, but I'm sure of one thing:
This is being made with love and, is a return of the favor that FNF community made me, improving myself and discovering feelings
> I hope that I will not be talking alone forever, It's wird sometimes
